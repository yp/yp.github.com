I am **Yuri Pirola**, a joint postdoctoral fellow in Computer Science at
the
[Department of Informatics Systems and Communication (DISCo)](http://www.disco.unimib.it/)
of the University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, and
[Parco Tecnologico Padano](http://www.tecnoparco.org), Lodi, Italy.

This page presents the latest *open-source* software projects which I have
contributed to during my research activities.
More information about me, my research interests, and my recent work are
available at my
[personal home page][yp].

## Haplotype Inference ##

### Heu-MCHC ###

[**Heu-MCHC**][HeuMCHC] is a fast and accurate heuristic algorithm for
the haplotype inference problem on pedigree data with recombinations and
mutations.

[**Heu-MCHC**][HeuMCHC] has been developed under the supervision of
[Tao Jiang][tj] and [Paola Bonizzoni][pb].


### ZRHC-* ###

[**ZRHC-\***][ZRHCstar] is a SAT-based program to compute a
zero-recombinant haplotype configuration with many missing genotypes.

[**ZRHC-\***][ZRHCstar] has been developed with the advice of
[Gianluca Della Vedova][gdv].



## Alternative Splicing and Gene Structure Prediction ##

### PIntron ###

[**PIntron**][PIntron] is a novel pipeline for gene-structure prediction based on
spliced alignment of transcript sequences (ESTs and mRNAs) against a
genomic sequence.

[**PIntron**][PIntron] has been developed with the collaboration of
[Raffaella Rizzi][rr] and [Gianluca Della Vedova][gdv] under the
supervision of [Paola Bonizzoni][pb].
